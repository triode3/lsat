          checkcfg prints output of chkconfig --list and is the last module run

        - Added large section in README.modules on writing modules with the new dostuff module.
        - Added modules that were missing in README.modules.
        - Added function in lsatmain to clean up mess if a module bombs out.
        - Output format has been changed slightly in appearance.
        - Modified all modules to use module dostuff for creating, writing, deleting tempfiles
          and for writing out to outfile. This should make module creation easier as one can
          concentrate on module content and not opening/writing/etc files.
        - checkinetd broken under redhat 7.x (or those that use xinetd.d) Should be FIXED.
        - Cleaned up verbose msgs.

	- Added checkkbd function to check for ctrl-alt-del or STOP-A disable.
 	- Fixed file perms. LSAT was not making the output file chmod 0600.

	- Set umask back to sensible value, regardless of previous value...
          (done so if user modifies files after running lsat the user will have a sensible umask)

	- Fixed error msg typos in lsatmain.c, checknet.c and checkfiles.c
- 0.4.0 - 04/15/2002 -
	- Unused vars in checkpkg removed.
	- Fixed bug in checkpasswd. (open file problem)
        - Now using mkstemp in lsatmain.c instead of just making a file.
          (this should be a little more secure in case of a tempfile exploit)
	- Many typos in checkdotfiles fixed.
	- Error msgs in all modules will (should) report module name on error.
	- Now using mkstemp in all modules. 
	- In lsatmain.c default value for distribution variable is now
